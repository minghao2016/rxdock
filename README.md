# rDock: a Fast, Versatile and Open Source Program for Docking Ligands to Proteins and Nucleic Acids

![rDock Logo](docs/_static/logo.png)

rDock is a fast and versatile **open-source docking program** that can
be used to dock **small molecules** against **proteins** and **nucleic
acids**. It is designed for High Throughput Virtual Screening (HTVS)
campaigns and Binding Mode prediction studies.

rDock is mainly written in C++ and accessory scripts and programs are
written in C++, Perl or Python languages.

The full rDock software package requires **less than 50 MB** of hard
disk space and it is compilable (at this moment, **only**) in **all
Linux computers**.

Thanks to its design and implementation, it can be installed on a
computation cluster and deployed on an **unlimited number of CPUs**,
allowing HTVS campaigns to be carried out in a **matter of days**.

Besides its main Docking program, the rDock software package also
provides a set of tools and scripts to facilitate **preparation** of the
input files and **post-processing** and **analysis** of results.

## About

### Features

![The above image illustrates the first binding mode solution for ASTEX
system 1hwi, with an RMSD of 0.88 Å.](docs/_images/dock1.jpg)

#### Docking preparation

Define cavities using **known binders** or with user-supplied **3D
coordinates**. Allow -OH and -NH2 receptor side chains to rotate.
Add explicit solvent molecules and structural waters. Supply
pharmacophoric restraints as a bias to **guide docking**.

#### Pre-Processing of input files

Define common ligand structure for performing **tethered docking**
(requires Open Babel Python bindings). Sort, filter or split ligand
files for facilitating **parallelization**. Find **HTVS protocol**
for optimizing calculation time. Pre-calculate grids to decrease
subsequent calculation times.

#### Post-Processing and analysis of results

Summarize results in a tabular format. Sort, filter, merge or split
results files. Calculate **RMSD** with a reference structure taking
into account internal symmetries (requires Open Babel Python
bindings).

#### Binding mode prediction

Predict how a ligand will bind to a given molecule. The ASTEX
non-redundant test set for proteins and DOCK and rDock test sets for
RNA have been used for validating and comparing rDock with other
programs.

#### HTVS

Run for million of compounds in short time by exploiting the
capabilities of computer calculation farms. Ease of
**parallelization** in relatively unlimited CPUs to optimize HTVS
running times. The DUD set has been used for validating rDock and
comparing its performance to other reference docking programs.

### History

The rDock program was developed from 1998 to 2006 by the software team
at RiboTargets (subsequently Vernalis (R&D) Ltd).

In 2006, the software was licensed to the University of York for
maintenance and distribution.

In 2012, Vernalis and the University of York agreed to release the
program as open-source software.

This version is developed with support from the University of Barcelona --
[http://sourceforge.net/projects/rdock/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/rdock/).
